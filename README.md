# Stores
Stores Web application using MVC , bootstrap and Knockoutjs

Goal: 
Be able to build an MVC application with Visual Studio and connect it to an SQL database 
- Use the razor view engine 
- Use bootstrap modals in views  
- Add data annotations to the models
- Use jQuery client-side validation 
- Use jQuery, JavaScript and AJAX calls to communicate with controllers and support functions on the page 
- Apply knockout to your project in place of razor and add knockout front-end validation  

The task consists of three different versions of the same project: 

Project 1: 
- MVC application connected to an SQL database 
- Razor view engine 
- Data annotations 

Project 2: 
- MVC application connected to an SQL database 
- Bootstrap modals 
- Data annotations 
- jQuery, JavaScript and AJAX to post to and get from controller 

Project 3: 
- MVC application connected to an SQL database 
- Knockout 
- Bootstrap modals 
- Data annotations 
- jQuery, JavaScript and AJAX to post to and get from the controller 
- Knockout frontend validation 


Instructions: 
Using the above model diagram, create an MVC application that enables the CRUD (Create, Update, Delete) operations. For project 1 each action will have its own view (this will change in project 2). 

Project 1: 
Use razor without AJAX to post to the controller, add data annotations.

Project 2: 
Research bootstrap modals to see how to combine all actions into the same view (There should be a total of four views, Customer, Store, Product and Sale/ProductSold). The modals should show and hide based on what action the user is doing. 
Use jQuery, JavaScript and AJAX to post to/get from the controller without knockout. 

Project 3: 
Use knockout with jQuery, JavaScript and AJAX to post to/get from the controller and knockout frontend validation.
